text: "Another day working on the Raspberry Pi Pico W project, feeling like the only developer on the planet. But behold an invite from devEco, a supportive community of developers. Sharing our passion, giving advice and helping each other out. Plus a place to share our projects in the devAnon monthly meetup.
devEco is unique in being supportive and managed space. The only place I call home on Discord."
